For Spark 1.X the variables are `sqlContext` and `sc`. \n\n在Spark 2.x中Spark的统一入口为SparkSession类，可以使用`spark`变量访问；而在Spark 1.x中，SparkSQL的入口为SQLContext类，对应通过变量sqlContext或sc访问，这两个变量在2.0中依然可用\n\nCells can be executed by hitting `shift+enter` while the cell is selected. \n\n选定的Cell可以使用`shift+enter`快捷键直接运行"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sqlContext\nsc"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## If you're on 2.X the spark session is made available with the variable below\n#####\n\nspark"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We can use the Spark Context to access information but we can also use it to parallelize a collection as well.

This provide us a convenient tour of some of the basic functionality and some of the nice features that makes running Spark on Databricks the simplest!

As you'll see above we don't get any results back! \n\nThe reason for that is because these computations are *lazy* in order to build up the entire flow of data from start to finish required by the user. This is an intelligent optimization for two key reasons. Any calculation can be recomputed from the very source data allowing Apache Spark to handle any failures that occur along the way, and successfully handle stragglers. Secondly, Apache Spark can optimize computation so that data and computation can be `pipelined` as we mentioned above. Therefore, with each transformation Apache Spark creates a plan for how it will perform this work.\n\nTo get a sense for what this plan consists of, we can use the `explain` method. Remember that none of our computations have been executed yet, so all this explain method does is tells us the lineage for how to compute this exact dataset."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 显示运算至该DataFrame的执行计划\ndf2.explain()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now explaining the above results is outside of this introductory tutorial, but please feel free to read through it.

This is a neat trick that you can use as a way to speed up access to commonly queried tables or pieces of data. This is also great for iterative algorithms that work over and over again on the same data. While many see this as a panacea for all speed issues, think of it much more like a tool that you can use. Other important concepts like data partitioning, clustering and bucketing can end up having a much greater effect on the execution of your job than caching, however, remember - these are all tools in your tool kit!\n\nTo cache a DataFrame or RDD, simply use the cache method."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df2.cache()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Caching, like a transformation, is performed lazily. That means that it won't store the data in memory until you call an action on that dataset. \n\nHere's a simple example. We've created our df2 DataFrame which is essentially a logical plan that tells us how to compute that exact DataFrame. We've told Apache Spark to cache that data after we compute it for the first time. So let's call a full scan of the data with a count twice. The first time, this will create the DataFrame, cache it in memory, then return the result. The second time, rather than recomputing that whole DataFrame, it will just hit the version that it has in memory.\n\nLet's take a look at how we can discover this."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df2.count()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["However after we've now counted the data.
