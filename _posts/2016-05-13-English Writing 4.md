* avoid using meanwile in academic writing
* use the most appropriate linker phrases to establish a clear and logical link between your statements
* remember that the use of linking phrases differs somewhat between Chinese and English

#### Punctuation

* full stops, use it generously, in academic writing, shorter sentences are better.
* comma, use for clauses, lists and with subordinators, use it with caution.
* semicolons, used to break up longer sentences, seprating long items in a list, use it occasionally.
* colons, used to introduce a list, compare with.

#### Conjuctions

||usage|examples|
|---|---|---|
|Conjuctions|Use a comma|and but, or|
|Connector|use a semicolon or period|however, thus, also|
|Subordinator|because, if, while|Use a comma.|



||Instead|
|---|---|
|BUT|In contrast, However, Unexpected, Surprisingly|
|AND|In addition, Also, Furthermore, Importantly|
|Thought|Only use after comma as part of a clause, even thouth |


* do not use conjuctions to link two sentences

#### Repetition

* repeat of words is NOT a problem in academic writing
* use -ed adjective instead passive verb

||Instead|
|---|---|
|were selected|selected strain|
|was purified|purified strains|


#### Time adverbials

once,first, next, then, finally, lastly

#### ing Clauses

* Prices rise, thus leading to a decrease in demand.
* emphasize cause and effect  used in combination with 'thus'
* once in a sentence to avoid ambiguity

#### This + summary word

* phrase that summarizes what has already been mentioned in the
preceding sentence
* THIS sometimes used 'unsupported' by noun

only do so if it is absolutely clear what THIS refers to!
